# Multi-Agent System using Meta LLaMA 3.3-70B (via OpenRouter API)

This project demonstrates how to build a **Multi-Agent AI System** that performs **market research** and **AI use case generation** for companies like Deloitte, McKinsey, and others using the **Meta LLaMA 3.3-70B-Instruct** model through the **OpenRouter API**.

Each agent plays a specific role â€” gathering data, analyzing it, and generating actionable insights â€” to simulate how intelligent AI agents can work collaboratively to automate research and strategy tasks.
