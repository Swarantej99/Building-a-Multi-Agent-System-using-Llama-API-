    "Previously, similar projects were showcased using the Gemini API. Here, we adapt the same architecture but with a free & publicly accessible model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The system consists of three agents:\n",
    "1. **Planner Agent** ‚Äî Breaks down a high-level topic into smaller research tasks  \n",
    "2. **Researcher Agent** ‚Äî Executes those tasks and gathers insights  \n",
    "3. **Summarizer Agent** ‚Äî Combines insights into a final summary  \n",
    "\n",
    "We‚Äôll pass prompts and messages between these agents to accomplish end-to-end research (e.g. ‚ÄúDo research on Tesla stock in upcoming days‚Äù)."
